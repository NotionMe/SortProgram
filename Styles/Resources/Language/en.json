    "BubbleSort_Description": "A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.",
    "SelectionSort_Description": "A comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It finds the smallest element and moves it to the beginning.",
    "QuickSort_Description": "A divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around it, so that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and larger ones are on the right.",
    "InsertionSort_Description": "Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Efficient for small data sets and is often used as part of more sophisticated algorithms.",
